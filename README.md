# School Projects

This repository contains a collection of my school projects. Each project is organized into its own directory with a separate text file explaining its purpose and usage.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a structured organization, with each project having its own directory. Inside each project directory, you can find the source code and any associated documentation.

Feel free to navigate through the projects to explore the work I've done during my studies.

## Usage

To explore a specific project, navigate to its directory and refer to the project's individual text file. The file will provide details about the project, including its purpose, usage instructions, and any additional notes or requirements.

## Contributing

This repository is for personal use and intended to showcase my school projects. But, contributions will still be appreciated. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.
