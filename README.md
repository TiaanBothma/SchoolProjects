# 🎓 School Projects by Tiaan Bothma

Welcome to my collection of school projects! Each project is uniquely organized into its own directory, accompanied by detailed documentation outlining its purpose and how to use it. Dive in and explore my work throughout my academic journey.

## 📂 Project Structure

Every project has its own directory containing:
- **Source code** 💻
- **Documentation** 📄: A text file in each project folder that explains the project’s goal, how to use it, and any important notes or requirements.

Feel free to browse around and explore!

## 🚀 Usage

To view a specific project:
1. Navigate to its directory.
2. Open the corresponding text file for all the necessary details, including usage instructions, project goals, and any prerequisites.
